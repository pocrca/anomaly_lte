# Anomaly detection in LTE activity

## Objective
1. Apply 3 supervised learning models to detect anormalies in LTE activity dataset.
2. Develop a simple GUI/web application to allow user interactivity with trained models. 

## Deliverables
Perform the following seperately:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook
2. End-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline (MLP) in Python Scripts
3. Simple GUI/web application in Python:
    - input: file containing test data
    - output: show model evaluation results  

Reproducibility for MLP is important:
* Don't develop MLP in an interactive notebook.
* Pipeline should be configurable to enable easy experimentation of different. You can consider the usage of a config file.

In final report & presentation: Provide descriptions:
1. Appropriate data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Appropriate use and optimization of algorithms/models
3. Explanation for the choice of algorithms/models
4. Explanation for the choice of evaluation metrics
    - Compare the 3 trained models using evaluation metrics
